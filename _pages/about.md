I am driven by a passion to enhance scientists' benchwork experience through the introduction and demonstration of innovative algorithms for computer vision applications. My journey in computer vision began during my Bachelorâ€™s degree under the mentorship of [Dr. Muhammad Sajjad](https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?user=E4-dElIAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Digital Image Processing Lab at Islamia College Peshawar, an experience that significantly inspired my interest in this field.

I earned my Ph.D. from the Intelligent Media Laboratory (IMLab) at Sejong University, South Korea, where I was mentored by [Prof. Sung Wook Baik](https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?user=9tXoIf0AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) and co-supervised by [Dr. Khan Muhammad](https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?user=k5oUZyQAAAAJ&hl).

I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher with [Prof. Fuxin Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=snDpfA0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Thomas G. Dietterich ](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/) at the Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CoRIS) Institute at Oregon State University, OR, United States.
