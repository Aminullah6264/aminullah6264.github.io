I am driven by a passion to enhance scientists' benchwork experience through the introduction and demonstration of innovative algorithms for computer vision applications. I received my Ph.D. degree from Intelligent Media Laboratory (IMLab), Sejong University, South Korea, supervised by [Prof. Sung Wook Baik](https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?user=9tXoIf0AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) and co-supervised by [Dr. Khan Muhammad](https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?user=k5oUZyQAAAAJ&hl). Currently, I am working as a Postdoc Researcher with [Prof. Fuxin Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=snDpfA0AAAAJ&hl=en) at the Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems ([CoRIS](https://robotics.oregonstate.edu/)) Institute, Oregon State University, OR, United States.
